You would need to make sure you have installed '@huggingface/transformers' and Node.js

If you don't have node download node from https://nodejs.org 

If you haven't already installed it or is not already installed with this file folder
install it by entering the command below while in this dierectory:

npm i @huggingface/transformers


This program was supposed to be integrated with the full model into the extension code however the model was too large to be added.

If you have the model running this code is simple.
To do a test, in the command line run 

node Transformer.js
