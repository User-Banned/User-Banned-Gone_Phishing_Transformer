This is two parts for the same feature for the Gone Phishing Extension demo.
This code does not include the models that were generated due to them being too large.

The first part is the py (Python) code where the main training is done as well as the conversion of the model from py to js (JavaScript).
The second part is the js where it should be then integrated into the extension code.
